autonomous navigation: numpy map, hard-coded movement, checks to keep robot in bounds and away from obstacles

autonomous navigation 1: added radius sensor which keeps track of obstacles near robot at each move

autonomous navigation 2: refined movement to allow for continuous movement in the discrete grid environment
