autonomous navigation: numpy map, hard-coded movement, checks to keep robot in bounds and away from obstacles

autonomous navigation 1: added radius sensor which keeps track of obstacles near robot at each move

autonomous navigation 2: refined movement to allow for continuous movement in the discrete grid environment

autonomous navigation 3: A* path finding implemented, tracks path and detected obstacles on path, random map generator

autonomous navigation 4: implemented a simple version of frontier-based exploration choosing only the closest frontier for robot to build its own map
